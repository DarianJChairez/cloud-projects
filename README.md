# Cloud Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cloud projects portfolioâ€”this repository showcases hands-on implementations across AWS, Azure, and Terraform. Each folder contains a focused deployment with documentation, live results (where applicable), and insights into key cloud concepts.

## AWS Projects

### [`aws-static-site`](./aws-cloud-projects/aws-static-site)  
Deploys a static website using Amazon S3, with optional CloudFront integration and IAM-based public access control.

## Terraform Projects

### [`terraform-cloud-projects`](./terraform-cloud-projects)  
Contains modular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) labs using Terraform CLI and the AzureRM provider.  
Current lab provisions:

- An Azure Resource Group (`rg-terraform-lab`)
- A Standard LRS Storage Account (`tfstoragelabjayce`)

All resources are deployed using `.tf` files and verified in the Azure Portal.  
This lab reinforces AZ-104 and Terraform Associate certifications through hands-on, cost-aware automation.
